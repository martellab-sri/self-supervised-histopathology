# Self supervised contrastive learning for digital histopathology

We release larger pretrained models (resnet34, resnet50, and resnet101) trained for the original work, which can be found in the **.ckpt** files in the following link:

https://github.com/martellab-sri/self-supervised-histopathology/releases/tag/largermodels

To view the training code and access the resnet18 pretrained weights, the original codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/ozanciga/self-supervised-histopathology).
